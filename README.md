# asya-becheva-employees

Get the pair of employees who have worked together on all common projects for the longest time.

The solution has 4 separate projects

+ Employees.Console with included sample .txt file in it, which will be used to calculate employees data and display them in the console.
+ Employees.Data holds the data models.
+ Employees.Web is the web application generated with ASP.NET MVC 5. A simple datagrid library called DataTables is added to present the result.
+ Employees.Services holds the services used for the console and web app

To check the accuracy of the console output data you can take the EmployeeData.txt from Employees.Console and use it for the web app

The result for Employees.Console shows the number of days for ALL projects where the employee pair worked together.
The result for Employees.Web shows the number of days for each project where employee pair worked together.
